### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Looking back, Lab 2 is one of my favorite labs because it is essentially the lab that got me fully accustomed to the basics of how these labs were going to work for the rest of the semester. With this lab, I was able to fully understand how to clone a repository, how to edit it, and how to push/submit the edited files.  This lab also helped me get used to initializing string variables, reading user input, and assigning user input to certain variables using std::cout and std::cin.

* Lab 6, part 2
    
    Lab 6, part 2, was also one of my favorite labs because of the work we had to do with if-statements. I found this lab interesting and somewhat challenging because of how we were tasked to create if-statements that needed to have very specific conditions in order to determine if the data inputted by the user was a certain type of card, such as an ace, face card, or number card. I also favored this lab as it helped me understand vectors a bit more.

* Lab 8, part 1
    
    Finally, I would also say that Lab 8 as a whole was one of my favorite labs, mostly because my partner and I finished everything in a little less than forty minutes. Though if I had to choose one part from the two, I would have to say part 1. I enjoyed part 1 because it involved things that my partner and I were already comfortable with coding. From part 1, I learned how to efficiently use loops to iterate through data in order to check if a certain condition is met, and I was able to improve my understanding of the differences between regular for-loops and for-each loops.
